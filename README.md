# Deadlocks (Important):
A situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a
resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. Deadlock
can arise if following four conditions hold simultaneously (Necessary Conditions):
1. Mutual Exclusion – One or more than one resource is non-sharable (Only one
process can use at a time).
2. Hold and Wait – A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for
resources.
3. No Preemption – A resource cannot be taken from a process unless the process
releases the resource.
4. Circular Wait – A set of processes are waiting for each other in circular form.

● Methods for handling deadlock: There are three ways to handle deadlock
1. Deadlock prevention or avoidance : The idea is to not let the system into a
deadlock state.
2. Deadlock detection and recovery : Let deadlock occur, then do preemption to
handle it once occurred.
3. Ignore the problem all together : If deadlock is very rare, then let it happen and
reboot the system. This is the approach that both Windows and UNIX take.
